## Generalities
Basically it is a small Bluetooth keyboard that presses the left (resp. right) arrow when punching the punching ball with the left (resp. right) glove.

The mapping of the controls is done as follows:

| Player 1   | Effect     |
|------------|------------|
| Left punch | Left arrow |
| Left punch | Left arrow |

... Yeah.

## Setup
Skip to [Usage](#usage) if you want to know how to use.

### Assembly
**TODO**

### Code
Please refer to the [main code README](./main/README.md).

## Usage
We are using [One Finger Death Punch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/264200/One_Finger_Death_Punch/) as our game for that project, but this should work with any other game.

You just have to connect the thing with Bluetooth to your computer. Its name is "One Finger Deux Punches".

> :information_source: **Note!** This setup requires an operator to handle the menu.

That's it! Punch left for left arrow, punch right for right arrow.

## Troubleshooting
None for now.
